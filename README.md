#### A 10 Meter 1200 Baud QPSK IP Node
Based on the Dire Wolf repository, it removes all the APRS, Repeaters, Beacons, FSK, and AFSK. The intent is to create a Linux based microcontroller with GPIO Push-To-Talk (PTT) Packet Radio Node transmitting QPSK. Currently set for 1200 Baud/2400 bit/s at 9600 sampling rate. It uses a Root-Raised-Cosine (RRC) matched filter on transmit and receive, and a slightly modified Improved Level 2 Protocol (IL2P). The Garner Timing Error Detection (TED) and Costas Loop is translated from GNU Radio.   

Designed for Internet Protocol (IP) use on 10 meters, which has a regulatory limit of 1200 Baud, and must operate in the **28.120 - 28.189 MHz** band if automatically controlled.   

The center frequency of ```1000 Hz``` was chosen to keep the signal in the audio bandpass of most radios. You could move this higher to about ```1600 Hz```, but this is the limit for most radios.   

The use of digipeaters have been removed, so the functionality of a repeater can be replaced using full-duplex (or cross-band) techniques. This prevents hidden nodes.   

IL2P was built upon AX.25 Version 2.0, thus a lot of the Version 2.2 functionality is not used in this protocol. The protocol was also modified to be hard-wired using only the maximum FEC and Header Type 1, as it is the most useful. It is used to transport Level 3 Internet Protocol (IP). There is some Broadcast functionality left, used for ARP, Node Identification, and multicast UDP. The KISS commands from the kernel are limited to sending data, and other command types are not processed.   

The modem uses the ALSA Linux Soundcard 16-bit stereo channel PCM, at a fixed 9.6 kHz sample rate. The network interface uses a Linux pseudo-terminal running the KISS protocol. This interfaces to the AX.25 Level 3 networking using the ```kissattach``` program, making the modem routable over IP.   
#### Status
Ubuntu desktop is used for development. The PTT code is currently commented out to prevent core dumps, as the desktop doesn't have the GPIO, but the idea is to run this on a Linux microcontroller when fully developed.   

The GPIO will need PTT, DCD, Connect, and Sync as interface lines.   

The Data Carrier Detect (DCD) and End Of Frame (EOF) logic needs development.   
#### Notes
The IL2P description says the idle symbols are supposed to be alternating ```0101``` binary during ```txdelay``` and ```txtail``` but this doesn't work for PSK, so we send '00' and '11' as BPSK.   

```
+----------------------+-------------+---------------------+
| txdelay idle symbols | IL2P packet | txtail idle symbols |
+----------------------+-------------+---------------------+

The following shows a series of pings, with no station answering, and the beginning is extranoues output from the chrome browser over UDP:

This has an exagerated ```txdelay``` and ```txtail``` which is the 1 kHz beeps you hear.

What the spectrum looks like:   

<img src="docs/actual-packet-data-spectrum.png" alt="actual spectrum" width="400"/>   

This is 1 kHz +/- 800 Hz or 1600 Hz bandwidth, so the **emission** symbol would be **1K60J2D**.
#### Startup
The ```ipnode``` program runs in a loop with three threads (tx, rx, and kiss). It will read the config file ```ipnode.conf``` if available, and begin running.
```
$ ipnode -h

usage: ipnode [options]

  --help    Print this message

```

Using ax25-tools and ```kissattach``` command seems to work well as the pseudo-terminal kiss interface.

Example:

Create the ```/etc/ax25/axports``` file:
```
#
# The format of this file is:
# name callsign speed paclen window description
#
ip172 W1AW-10 0	256 7	ip172 port (1200 Baud QPSK)
```

Execute like:
```
$ ipnode >>ipnode.log & 
Audio device for both receive and transmit: default
Created symlink /tmp/kisstnc -> /dev/pts/2
Virtual KISS TNC is available on /dev/pts/2

$ sudo kissattach $(ls -l /tmp/kisstnc | awk '{print $NF}') ip172
$ sudo ip addr add 172.30.10.1/24 dev ax0
```
You should see a new interface called ```ax0``` which should look something like this:
```
$ ifconfig ax0
ax0: flags=67<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING>  mtu 255
        inet 172.30.10.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 0.0.0.0
        ax25 W1AW-10  txqueuelen 10  (AMPR AX.25)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 97  bytes 11112 (11.1 KB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```
A routing table might look like this:
```
$ route -4n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 enp1s0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 enp1s0
172.30.10.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 ax0
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     100    0        0 enp1s0
```
When you are done, or you want to restart, you can delete the kissattach using:
```
sudo pkill -f "kissattach"
```
You can use ```wireshark``` to view the ```ax0``` interface.
